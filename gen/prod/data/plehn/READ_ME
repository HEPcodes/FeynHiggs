In this directory you find different files dealing with the 
LHC process gb->tH-. If you download any of the files/results, 
please send me an email: tilman.plehn@cern.ch

This way I can inform you if there turns out to be bug in 
this of course entirely bug free set of numbers and notes 
in this directory.

So here is the list of the files:

results_array.dat: Array including the LO and NLO cross sections
                   for gb->tH- in pb. Note that the factor 2 for the 
                   tbarH+ final state is not included. Running masses
                   and couplings are consistently computed to LO 
                   or NLO, respectively. The renormalization scale is
                   set to (mH+mt)/2, the factorization scale is set 
                   to (mH+mt)/5. Explicit NLO-SUSY diagrams are not 
                   included, you can think of it as the NLO calculation 
                   in a general 2HDM. If you want to know more about 
                   the calculation, please consult and hep-ph/0206121
                   hep-ph/0304034.

                   One word concerning the NLO cross sections. I know 
                   some experiments as a principle of belief to not use
                   NLO results. However, if you are using the usual recipes 
                   to combine 2->2 and 2->3 cross sections, you are already
                   include part of the NLO results, so why not go all the 
                   way? Secondly, if you for example use pole mass Yukawa
                   couplings your LO cross section is far larger than 
                   the NLO results, the NLO effects are then large and 
                   negative. 
                  
                   Concerning the low mH end of the spectrum the NLO 
                   2->2 process is always well defined. The intermediate 
                   on-shell contribution from the pp->tt, t->bH channel
                   can be subtracted consistently in the narrow width
                   approximation. This method avoids any double counting 
                   between the NLO bg->tH and the gg->tt process and 
                   is what we have been using for SUSY pair production
                   or stop-lepton production. Typically the variation of 
                   the K factor for the bg->tH process as a function 
                   of mH is small. A particular uncertain region is 
                   mH=mt plus/minus a few time Gamma_t. In the new table
                   the low mH region is covered, a detailed description
                   can be found in hep-ph/0312286. Note that this rate 
                   has to be added to the pp->ttbar sample with a 
                   subsequent top decay to a charged Higgs.

fix_pythia.f: Bug fix for all PYTHIA versions 6.2xxx (thanks to 
              Dirk Zerwas for his great help digging it out during 
              the Les Houches workshop may/June 2003). Differences
              between the LO numbers in results_array.dat and PYTHIA 
              output are due to leading order theoretical uncertainties.
              Note that these differences do not give you measure of 
              the actual size of theoretical uncertainties.

versus_mh_sig.eps: Cross section plot out of hep-ph/0206121.
versus_mh_k.eps:   K factor plot out of hep-ph/0206121. 
                   Modulo scale choices the numbers are identical 
                   to those in the file results_array.dat.

Enjoy, good luck, cheers, bless you, gesundheit,...

P.S.: List of changes
6/13/03 results_array.dat: All cross sections scaled with a 
                           factor 10, due to a stupid historic typo 
                           in the code. Now the numbers and the plot
                           do agree! Sorry!
7/14/03 results_array.dat: Small values for tan(beta) added in the array,
                           cross section increase because of mt/tan(beta)
                           term in the coupling. 

2/01/04 results_array.dat: Consistent treatment of low mH region,
                           new coverage down to 140 GeV

8/09/05 results_array.2.dat: Now with smaller step size
        results_array.3.dat: Now with even smaller step size
